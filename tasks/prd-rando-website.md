# Product Requirements Document: Rando Website

## Introduction/Overview

Rando is a retro-themed website that allows users to discover random websites on the internet through a single, prominent button click. The site features a nostalgic early PC aesthetic and includes a global click counter to track community engagement. Users can share the Rando experience on social media, but individual random sites are not directly shareable to maintain the surprise element.

**Problem Statement:** Internet users often get stuck in their usual browsing patterns and miss out on discovering interesting, lesser-known websites. Rando solves this by providing a fun, safe way to explore the web randomly.
